    <h1>About the Project</h1>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Automating the Transcription of Books with Ancient Earthquakes to Semantic Descriptions using LLMs and Knowledge Graphs</p>
    
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The primary goal of this project is to develop a novel dataset by transcribing historical books that document ancient earthquakes into structured semantic descriptions. This will be achieved using state-of-the-art techniques, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs.</p>
    
    <h2>Research and Innovation</h2>
    <p>Through this project, we aim to explore and investigate cutting-edge methodologies for data modeling and transcription. By leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence and knowledge representation, we aspire to create something unique and innovative that can contribute to the academic community.</p>
    
    <h2>Academic Impact</h2>
    <p>Our findings and dataset will be publicly available, fostering further research and development in this field. Additionally, we aim to submit our work to the <strong>International Joint Conference on Knowledge Graphs (IJCKG) 2025</strong> in Heraklion, or another relevant academic venue.</p>
